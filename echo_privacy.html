<h1>EchoPath – Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><small>Effective: 2025-08-07</small></p>

<p>EchoPath is provided by NeuralAutomate (“we”, “us”). This policy explains what information the app processes and how it is handled.</p>

<h2>What the app processes</h2>
<p>EchoPath monitors your device’s call state and network type to help you understand when calls occur over Wi‑Fi Calling (VoWiFi) or cellular. The app processes the following <strong>on your device only</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Call events: start/end timestamps, a random call identifier, and call duration.</li>
  <li>Network transitions during a call (e.g., Wi‑Fi/VoWiFi, LTE, 5G).</li>
  <li>App settings you choose.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EchoPath does not access or record</strong> call audio, phone numbers, contacts, messages, photos, precise location, advertising identifiers, or any content of your communications.</p>

<h2>How data is used</h2>
<p>Data is used solely to show history and analytics inside the app. We do not collect, transmit, sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.</p>

<h2>Storage and retention</h2>
<p>All data is stored locally on your device (SQLite). You can delete it at any time from the app’s settings (Clear Logs) or by uninstalling the app.</p>

<h2>Permissions</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Call/telephony status (CallKit)</strong>: to detect when calls start/end.</li>
  <li><strong>Network information (Network framework)</strong>: to determine current connection type (Wi‑Fi/VoWiFi or cellular).</li>
</ul>
<p>The app does not request microphone, camera, contacts, photos, or location permissions.</p>

<h2>Analytics, tracking, and ads</h2>
<p>EchoPath contains no third‑party analytics SDKs, ad SDKs, or tracking. We do not track you across apps or websites.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Because data remains on your device, it is protected by your device’s security features. We recommend keeping your OS updated.</p>

<h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
<p>EchoPath is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>We may update this policy as the app evolves. We will post updates on this page with a new effective date.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions or requests (including data deletion), contact: <a href="mailto:support@neuralautomate.xyz">support@neuralautomate.xyz</a>.<br>
